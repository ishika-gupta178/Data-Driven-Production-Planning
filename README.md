# Data-Driven-Production-Planning

Applied Monte Carlo simulation using @RISK (Palisade DecisionTools Suite) within Microsoft Excel to determine the optimal production plan for a drug produced by Wozac Company, a pharmaceutical manufacturer.

Modeled uncertainty in batch production time, yield, and inspection success using appropriate probability distributions, such as discrete and triangular distributions, to accurately reflect real-world variability.

Simulated production scenarios to estimate the number of days required to fulfill an 8,000-ounce customer order of the new drug.

Determined both the average production time and the number of days needed to ensure 95% confidence in meeting the delivery deadline.

Utilized advanced Excel functions, including IF, nested IFs, SUMIF, COUNTIF, and MATCH for analysis.
